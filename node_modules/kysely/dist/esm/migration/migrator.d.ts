 * ### Example
 *
 * This example uses the {@link FileMigrationProvider} that reads migrations
 * files from a single folder. You can easily implement your own
 * {@link MigrationProvider} if you want to provide migrations some
 * other way.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const migrator = new Migrator({
 *   db,
 *   provider: new FileMigrationProvider(
 *     // Path to the folder that contains all your migrations.
 *     'some/path/to/migrations'
 *   )
 * })
 * ```

     * {@link MigrationResultSet.error} holds the error if something went wrong.
     * {@link MigrationResultSet.results} contains information about which migrations
     * were executed and which failed. See the examples below.
     *
     * This method goes through all possible migrations provided by the provider and runs the
     * ones whose names come alphabetically after the last migration that has been run. If the
     * list of executed migrations doesn't match the beginning of the list of possible migrations
