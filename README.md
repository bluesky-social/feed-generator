# Flamengo Bluesky Feed Generator

This is the source code for the [Bluesky Flamengo Feed](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:56dp2st2pupnf7qsxko2qmmd/feed/flamengo). Feel free to submit a PR with changes that you wish to see to the feed.

Currently, the matching is performed in `src/subscription.ts`, so add to those hardcoded lists if you want to add or remove something for now.

The original instructions are located [here](README-original.md) in case you wish to run this locally.
